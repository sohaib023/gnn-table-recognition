# gnn-table-recognition

Repository containing unofficial code for a modification to the arxiv paper 1905.13391 [(link)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13391.pdf).

[Link to the repository](https://github.com/shahrukhqasim/TIES-2.0/) containing offical source code for the paper.

Modifications in this code as compared to original paper:
  - Converted Tensorflow code to PyTorch.
  - Predict cell mergings for previously predicted cells, instead of performing complete extraction using the GNN.
  
TODO:
  - Provide details for setting up and usage of this repository.
  - Add a branch containing pytorch implementation of the unmodified paper.
